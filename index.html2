			<h2>Story Background</h2>
			<p>Lightning Farron has raised her younger sister, Serah, since she was fifteen years old.  
				With both of her parents gone, she had changed her name from Claire Farron 
				to Lightning.</p>
			<p>Not long before her twenty-first birthday, Lightning meets Snow, the leader
				of a group known as NORA.  Snow also happens to be Serah's boyfriend.
				Lightning doesn't approve of the vigilante ways of NORA and demands that
				Snow stop seeing Serah.  While at the Bodhum fireworks festival, Lightning
				hears about a Pulse-related incident at Vestige which is being kept secret
				by the Sanctum.</p>
			<p>Then on Lightning's twenty-first birthday, Serah reveals that she has been
				branded as a l'Cie, and that she and Snow are engaged.  After fighting with
				Serah, Lightning takes off and opens the birthday present Serah gave her:
				a survival knife.</p>
			<p>This all leads up to Final Fantasy VIII.</p>
